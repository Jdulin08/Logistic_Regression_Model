Data Analysis Project in R Programming:                                                                                                                                                                                                                Building and Fitting a Logistic Regression Model that is based on a Heart Disease Patient dataset with several characteristics. Along with creating a Logistic Regression Model, I inspected fitted models, and associated tests, and fit additional hypothesized regression models of my choosing, in a sensible sequence that leads to a more parsimonious 'final' model. At each of these steps, I removed only one predictor -â€“ or one conceptual group of predictors -- that has become unimportant at that step, until reaching a "final" parsimonious model of the relationship between Heart Disease and some, or all, of the predictors used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Then, I calculated and interpreted the Odds Ratio and Confidence Interval (95%) for each of the following questions:          a) Are obese hypertensive subjects more likely to have heart disease than normal weight hypertensive subjects, controlling for all other variables in the model?                                                                                             b) Are obese hypertensive subjects more likely to have heart disease than overweight hypertensive subjects, controlling for all other variables in the model?                                                                                             c) Are obese hypertensive subjects more likely to have heart disease than overweight non- hypertensive subjects, controlling for all other variables in the model?                                                                                        d) Are normal weight hypertensive subjects more likely to have heart disease than overweight non- hypertensive subjects, controlling for all other variables in the model?
